# Toasty 🍞

The smart, context-aware AI code reviewer from OWASP BLT.

## Overview

Toasty is an AI-powered code review service designed to help developers improve code quality through automated analysis and intelligent suggestions. It consists of:

- **Django Application** (`/aibot`, `/toasty`) - Main Django-based application
- **Cloudflare Worker** (root directory) - Serverless Python backend using Cloudflare Workers
- **GitHub App** (`app.js`) - Responds to `/plan` and other slash commands on issues

## Features

- 🤖 **AI Code Reviews** - Automated, security-focused analysis of pull requests
- 📋 **/plan Command** - Comment `/plan` on any issue to receive a structured implementation plan
- 🚀 **Serverless Architecture** - Built on Cloudflare Workers for global low-latency
- 🔐 **Security-First** - HMAC signature validation, OWASP Top 10 detection

## Using the /plan Command

Once Toasty is installed on a repository, comment `/plan` on any issue to receive a structured code implementation plan:

1. Open or create an issue
2. Comment: `/plan`
3. Toasty responds with a detailed 6-step plan based on the issue title and description

## Components

### GitHub App (Slash Commands)

The GitHub App listens for issue comments and responds to slash commands like `/plan`.

**Setup:**
```bash
# Install Node dependencies
npm install

# Start the GitHub App locally
npm start
```

Configure environment variables (copy `.env.example` to `.env`):
- `APP_ID` - Your GitHub App ID
- `WEBHOOK_SECRET` - Your webhook secret
- `PRIVATE_KEY_PATH` - Path to your private key

### Django Application

The main Django application provides the core functionality for Toasty.

**Setup:**
```bash
# Install dependencies
poetry install

# Run migrations
python manage.py migrate

# Start the development server
python manage.py runserver
```

### Cloudflare Worker Backend

A serverless backend built with Cloudflare Workers and Python for globally distributed, low-latency API endpoints.

**Features:**
- Health monitoring endpoints
- Code review API
- Status monitoring
- CORS support with preflight handling
- Comprehensive error handling and validation

**Quick Start:**
```bash
# Install Node dependencies (including Wrangler CLI)
npm install

# Run locally
npm run dev

# Deploy
npm run deploy
```

## API Endpoints

The Cloudflare Worker provides these REST endpoints:

- `GET /` - Service information
- `GET /health` - Health check
- `POST /api/review` - Submit code for review
- `GET /api/status` - Service status

See `worker.py` for detailed API documentation.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Python >=3.13,<4.0.0
- Poetry (for Django app)
- Node.js 18+ and npm (for Cloudflare Worker and GitHub App)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install Django dependencies: `poetry install`
3. Install Worker/App dependencies: `npm install`
4. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your values
